## Introduction

Git messages are one of the things that we software engineers love to hate.
Do it right and you will have a clean git log which everyone in your team will
appreciate and love. Do it wrong and good luck finding out which commit that
needs to be reverted because of production issues.

If git messages are important, how can we maintain a clean git log then? This
is the question that will be answered by this blog post.

## Setting up CommitLint

[CommitLint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) is a linting tool to lint commits.
Just like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), CommitLint has it's own set of rules
that our commits need to follow. In this tutorial, we're going to use
[conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

To install CommitLint and config-conventional, you need to run this command:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}
```

To use it, we need to create a file called `.commitlintrc` on our project root
and extend config-conventional rules.

```json
{
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"]
}
```

Now, we need to setup `husky` so that it will lint our commit message using git
hooks.

## Setting up Husky

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is, to put it simply, a helper to
run Git hooks. You can use it to lint commit messages with the help of
`commitlint`, run tests, lint code, etc. To install `husky` on your project,
run the following command:

```bash
npx husky-init && npm install
```

It will:

1. Add `prepare` script to your `package.json`
1. Create a sample `pre-commit` hook
1. Configure Git hooks path

You need to add another hook called `commit-msg` using `husky add` so that
`husky` will lint your commit message.

```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"'
```

Now you can try to commit your changes. If your commit message doesn't follow
`config-conventional` rules, you will see something like this:

That's because we don't follow `<type>[optional scope]: <description>` structure.
Try changing your commit message to be `feat: initial commit` and see your
changes being committed.

That's it for now. Stay tuned for my next post!
