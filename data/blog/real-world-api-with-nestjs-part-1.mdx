## Introduction to NestJS

[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), according to the official website, is "a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications."
Compared with other frameworks like [Express](https://expressjs.com/), NestJS is quite opinionated about how we should do something and how we should structure our code.
This can be considered a good thing, especially if you don't have a lot of production experience since it forces us to follow best practices and keeping our code consistent.

## Installing NestJS

You need to first install NestJS CLI if you haven't already.

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Then, scaffold the project with the following command.

```bash
nest new <project-name>
```

If you want to have a stricter feature set, like I'm gonna do, use `--strict` flag like this:

```bash
nest new --strict <project-name>
```

The above command will generate a new project with the following structure.

If you want to start building right away, you can skip the next section. But, if you want to extend existing [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) config,
e.g. using [Airbnb's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), read on.

## (Optional) Setup Airbnb's ESLint Config

As I have wrote [previously](https://www.veriferdiansyah.dev/blog/setup-eslint-prettier), ESLint and Prettier are important to ensure that you have a
good developer experience. I personally love Airbnb's style guide and that's why I always use it whenever I'm creating a new JavaScript/TypeScript project.
Beside Airbnb, there are a couple widely used style guide such as [standard](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard) and
[Google](https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google).

Since we're not using [React](https://react.dev/), we're going to use [eslint-config-airbnb-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base)
instead of [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).

```bash
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb-base
```

What this command does is that it will install `eslint-config-airbnb-base` alongside `eslint` and `eslint-plugin-import`.
Since we're using TypeScript, we need another library called [eslint-config-airbnb-typescript](https://github.com/iamturns/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript)
for our linter to work.

```bash
npm i --save-dev eslint-config-airbnb-typescript
```

And that's it. You're done. Try running `npx eslint "{src,apps,libs,test}/**/*.ts"` and you're going to see results like this:

![ESLint Check](/static/images/real-world-api-with-nestjs-part-1/eslint-check.png)

To automatically fix auto-fixable problems, run ESLint with `--fix` flag like this `npx eslint "{src,apps,libs,test}/**/*.ts" --fix`.

Another optional thing, you can add couple more plugins like [eslint-plugin-promise](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-promise),
[eslint-plugin-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest), or [eslint-plugin-security](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-security)
if you want your styling to be more comprehensive.

In the next part of this series, I'm going to explain about [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)
and [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to further upgrade your developer experience.
Stay tuned for more!
