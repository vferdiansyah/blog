## Introduction

An application, especially backend application, usually need some kind of
configuration for it to work properly. This configuration could hold public
or sensitive information such as our database connections, caching, feature
flags, and so on. We can even make so that our app will not be able to run if
some configuration settings are missing.

Often times, we also need our app to run in different environments like
`development`, `staging`, and `production`. Depending on the environment, we
need to use different configuration settings.

Let's see how we can add this kind of configuration to our NestJS app.

## Installing Dependency

First, we need to install the required dependency.

```bash
npm i @nestjs/config
```

Internally, this package is using [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

## Adding Your First Config

Create a new file called `.env` in your project root. And put your configuration
in it. For example, let's store a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
database configuration:

```
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_NAME=postgres
DATABASE_PORT=5432
```

The above config is just an example. You should replace it with your own config.

By default, `@nestjs/config` package will look for a `.env` file in the root
directory of your application. If you don't want to use `.env` but prefer to use
let's say a `.env.local` file, you can customize the package to read your custom
file as well. I'll explain how in the next section.

## Load Your Config

To load your config, first you need to import `ConfigModule` into
your `AppModule`.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot()],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This method will load and parse your configuration. If you are using filenames
beside `.env`, you can specify it in the `ConfigModule.forRoot()` like this:

```typescript
ConfigModule.forRoot({
  envFilePath: ['.env.local', '.env.development'],
});
```

## Using Your Config

To use your configuration within your module, you will need to import
`ConfigModule` into the module that will use it.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  // ...
})
```

Then, inject it into your constructor:

```typescript
constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {}
```

And we can use it like this:

```typescript
const dbName = this.configService.get<string>('DATABASE_USER');
```

That's it! Now you have a working config for your app.
