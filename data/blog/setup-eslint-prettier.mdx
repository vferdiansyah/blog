Developer experience is really important when you are working on a project.
A good developer experience is going to help you and your team be more productive,
and eventually, produce better code which leads to better product.

One of the easiest thing that you can do to improve your developer experience is to
enforce the same code-styling rules. If you are working in a team, everyone's coding style
might be different, especially if they are used to different programming languages.
This is where [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) came into the scene.

ESLint is a highly configurable JavaScript linting tool which can be used to find and
fix problems and issues with your code. You and your team can choose which rules to enable or disable.

Prettier, unlike ESLint, is focused purely on code formatting. It can be used for other programming
languages other than JavaScript such as HTML, CSS, Markdown, JSON, etc. And unlike ESLint, there are
not many configuration that you can do.

## Getting Started

In a new workspace, use `npm init` to generate a new `package.json` file.

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "name": "a-very-cool-project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Setup ESLint and Prettier

Run the following command from your CLI:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier
```

What this command do is that it will install `eslint`, `prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier` to your project,
and add it to your `devDependencies`.

## Create ESLint Config File

To configure ESLint, you need to add a configuration file to your project. Run the following command from your CLI:

```bash
npm init @eslint/config
```

When prompted, choose `To check syntax and find problems` and output the file as JSON for now.
Your generated configuration should look like this (more or less, depending on other options):

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "env": {
    "es2021": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": "latest",
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "rules": {}
}
```

## Create Prettier Config File

In the root of your project, create `.prettierrc` file and add the following config:

```json filename=".prettierrc"
{
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```

This configuration tells Prettier to wrap lines that are more than 80 characters
and to use 2 spaces for indentation.

Let's create a `.prettierignore` file in our root project to tell Prettier which know
which files/directories that we don't want to format.

```json filename=".prettierignore"
# Ignore artifacts:
package-lock.json
build
coverage
```

## Resolving Conflict Between ESLint and Prettier Rules

Since we installed `eslint-config-prettier`, we are going to use it to automatically
turn off ESLint rules that Prettier should handle. In the `.eslintrc.json` file, we
should add Prettier to the extends array - making sure that it goes last so that it
has the chance to override other configs.

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "env": {
    ...
  },
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "prettier"],
  "parserOptions": {
    ...
  },
  "rules": {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Add Scripts to Package.json

To test our configuration, add the below scripts to your `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "prettier:check": "npx prettier --check .",
    "prettier:fix": "npx prettier --write .",
    "lint": "npx eslint ."
    ...
  },
}
```

Now you can run

```bash
npm run lint // run ESLint on all files

npm run prettier:check // Prettier check all files
npm run prettier:fix // Prettier check all files and fix automatically
```

And we're done! Enjoy your freshly formatted code!
