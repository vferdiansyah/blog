I am an experienced software engineer, with experience in multiple startups across several different verticals
from e-commerce, fintech, media, and logistics. I mainly code in JavaScript and TypeScript in both frontend and backend,
using React and NodeJS. My go-to cloud provider is AWS, with some experience in GCP.

Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I am currently open for new opportunities. If you're hiring for a software engineer,
hit me up on my email or my social media account to the left!
